# 2.3 Reverse Schedule 

Used in project management, the Gantt chart is one of the most concrete tools for visually representing the progress of the various activities (tasks) that constitute a project. Often, the left column of the diagram lists all the tasks to be performed and the header line represents the most appropriate time units (or dates) for the project (days, weeks, months, etc.). 

# 2.7 The Study of Keywords

To choose the keywords, we must ask ourselves the following questions:

	– Has this word been searched for enough?
	– Is this word too competitive?
	– Does this word match the theme of my page?
	– Who positions themselves with regard to this word? (See competitors in search results.)
	Keywords are part of SEO’s semantic strategy. They are very important to define and target the way a site wants to communicate and position itself.

	The study of keywords is also an essential step in an SEO strategy, because it allows you to:

	– be aware of how Internet users talk about a theme;
	– understand the expectations of Internet users with regard to a subject;
	– optimize the website with popular keywords;
	– position yourself around sought-after and specific requests for which you want to be a specialist in your niche.

#2.12 Follow-up Maintenance and reporting 

Start monitoring the evolution of the site via KPIs 

	– monthly SEO positions;
	– unique monthly visits;
	– number of page views;
	– backlinks;
	– remaining 404 error pages;
	– remaining 3xx pages (to be removed);
	– bounce rate;
	– monthly conversions;
	– monthly turnover;
	– page indexing rate (number of real pages in the site versus the number of pages indexed by search engines).
	Traffic performance measurement tools exist for each search engine. Here are the best known, which we use regularly:

	– Google Analytics (American);
	– Baidu Tongji (Chinese);
	– Yandex Metrica (Russian).
